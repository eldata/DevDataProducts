**THE INPUT**  (What to do...)

- *Number of Observations (Days):*  drag slider left or right to change the number of observations. This feature sets the number of simulations.
- *Expected Annual Return (Percent):*  drag slider left or right to change desired input.  This feature adjusts the "Expected Annual Return" of a single investment that you want to simulate over time. 
- *Volatility (Percent):*  drag slider left or right to change desired input.  This feature adjusts the "Annual Volatility" that your single investment is expected to move up or down in a year. 


**THE OUTPUT**  (What you get...)

The output is a histogram resulting from the above inputs.  The whole point of this App is to illustrate visually that  regardless of the inputs, the distribution (as displayed) in the output is eventually "normally distributed" or (bell-shaped) as the number or simulations (observations) increases.  This is known as the "Central Limit Theorem".  Learn more: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/statistics-inferential/sampling_distribution/v/central-limit-theorem
